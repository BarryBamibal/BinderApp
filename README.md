#Description
Open web pages from your desktop easily. Simply start the Binder app and enter the word you linked to a URL. Thanks to the new way chrome apps work, you can now launch them from your taskbar or your desktop and easily access the websites you want.

You can make it even faster by enabling supersearch to instantly go to a site when you typed the word you want. You can also have a shortcut launch Binder itself or even a website itself.

You can also use the search function of sites quickly from your desktop. Instead of going to chrome, going to the website you want to search, then entering something in the search bar and hitting enter, you can now launch Binder, type in the word you linked to the site you want to search and enter what you want to search and you're done.

Link as many sites to bindings as you want, and if you want open multiple sites at once. Easily customize the look of the app and make opening websites as easy as you want.
